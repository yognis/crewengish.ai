   - Real-time updates when new exams start
   - **Result:** Shows "🔥 X kişi bugün sınav yaptı"

4. ✅ **Real-time Subscriptions**
   - Supabase Realtime channels configured

### **Session 3 (2025-10-29): Exit Flow Fix & System Stabilization ✅**

**CRITICAL BUG RESOLVED:**

1. ✅ **Fixed Exam Exit Flow Bug**
   - **Issue:** "Resume from where you left off" message appearing incorrectly after exam exit
   - **Root Cause:** Browser back button bypassed proper exit flow, leaving sessions stuck as 'in_progress'
   - **Solution Implemented:**
     - Back button now triggers exit confirmation modal
     - Properly calls EXIT_EXAM API to update session status
     - Database status correctly changes from 'in_progress' to 'exited'
   - **Result:** Clean exit flow, no resume prompts on new exams

2. ✅ **Database Cleanup Completed**
   - Cleaned 3 stuck sessions manually via SQL
   - Updated all stuck sessions from 'in_progress' to 'exited'
   - **Verification:** 0 stuck sessions remaining in database

3. ✅ **Dev Server Stabilization**
   - Killed multiple ghost Node.js processes (ports 3000-3007)
   - Cleared compilation issues
   - **Result:** Server running cleanly and stably

**Impact:** Critical user experience issue resolved. Users can now properly exit exams and start fresh ones without confusion.

### **Session 2 (2025-10-29): UI Polish & Bug Fixes ✅**

**Major Fixes Completed:**
1. ✅ **Fixed Jest Worker Error**
   - Created `next.config.js` to exclude test files from compilation
   - Issue: Next.js was trying to compile `.test.tsx` files causing crashes
   - Solution: Configured webpack to ignore test files
   - Result: Dev server now runs without errors

2. ✅ **Fixed Chat Container UI Issue**
   - Removed excessive height constraints causing empty space
   - Changed from `maxHeight: "100dvh"` to natural flex layout
   - Result: Cleaner exam page layout without empty space below

3. ✅ **Dashboard Cleanup**
   - Removed duplicate "Son Sınavlarım" section
   - Kept the detailed table with score breakdowns (better UX)
   - Result: Cleaner, less redundant dashboard

4. ✅ **Fixed Empty State Flash**
   - Added `!loading &&` check before showing EmptyState
   - Prevents "İlk Sınavınızı Başlatın!" from flashing during load
   - Result: Smoother loading experience

### **Previous Status:**
- Day 1 (2025-10-28): 60% complete

**Priority:** 🟢 NICE TO HAVE
**Status:** Current loading states work, but could be enhanced

**Files to Check/Update:**
- `src/components/exam/chat/ChatContainer.tsx` (already has loading state)

**Optional Enhancement:**
1. Add progressive loading indicators (if time permits):
   ```typescript
   // Progressive loading stages
   {stage === 'uploading' && (
     <>
       <UploadIcon className="animate-spin" />
       <p>Ses kaydınız yükleniyor...</p>
       <ProgressBar value={uploadProgress} />
       <span>{uploadProgress}%</span>
     </>
   )}

   {stage === 'transcribing' && (
     <>
       <TextIcon className="animate-pulse" />
       <p>Konuşmanız metne dönüştürülüyor...</p>
     </>
   )}

   {stage === 'evaluating' && (
     <>
       <BrainIcon className="animate-pulse" />
       <p>Cevabınız değerlendiriliyor...</p>
       <ul className="text-sm mt-2">
         <li>✓ Akıcılık analizi</li>
         <li>✓ Gramer kontrolü</li>
         <li className="opacity-50">⏳ Telaffuz...</li>
       </ul>
     </>
   )}
   ```

2. Add skeleton screens (1 hour):
   ```typescript
   // For score card loading
   <div className="animate-pulse">
     <div className="h-8 bg-gray-200 rounded w-1/3" />
     <div className="h-4 bg-gray-200 rounded w-full mt-2" />
   </div>
   ```

**Deliverable:** ✅ Professional loading UX

   ```typescript
   // Add to all interactive elements
   <button
     onClick={startRecording}
     aria-label="Ses kaydını başlat"
     aria-pressed={isRecording}
   >
     <MicIcon />

         aria-label={`Soru ${msg.number}`}
       >
         {msg.content}
       </div>
     ))}
   </div>
   ```

2. **Keyboard navigation (30 min):**
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
       if (e.key === 'Escape' && isRecording) {
         stopRecording();
       }
       if (e.key === ' ' && !isRecording) {
         e.preventDefault();
         startRecording();
       }
     };

     window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
     return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
   }, [isRecording]);
   ```

   ```
   ✓ User logs in
   ✓ Starts exam
   ✓ Answers 5 questions
   ✓ Receives scores
   ✓ Completes exam
   ✓ Views results
   ```

2. **Error recovery (30 min):**
