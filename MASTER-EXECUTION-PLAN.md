#### **1. Community Page Implementation ✅**
**New Feature:** Dedicated `/topluluk` (Community) page

**What Was Built:**

- **Live Stats Dashboard** (3 cards):
  - Total Members (real-time user count)
  - Active Today (users who took exams today) - highlighted in red
  - Total Exams (all completed exams)
- **Recent Activity Feed** with real-time updates
  - Shows last 10 completed exams
  - User names (first name + last initial for privacy)
  - Scores prominently displayed
  - Time ago ("5 dk önce", "2 saat önce")
  - Fade-in animations for visual appeal
  - Live dot indicator showing real-time updates
- **Join CTA Card** encouraging first exam
  - 3 benefit checkmarks
  - Direct link to exam start

**Technical Implementation:**

- Uses existing `useTotalUsers` and `useTodayActiveUsers` hooks
- Real-time Supabase subscriptions for live data

---

#### **2. Pricing Strategy Finalization ✅**
**Based on RevenueCat "State of Subscription Apps 2025" Report**

**Key Decisions:**
1. **Monetization Model:** Credit-based (one-time purchase, not subscription)
2. **Freemium Strategy:** 3 free credits on signup
3. **Single-Tier Pricing:** 3 credits = 200 TRY
4. **Payment Gateway:** Stripe (ready for integration)

**Pricing Page Updates:**
- **Before:** 3 pricing tiers (5, 15, 30 credits)
- **After:** Single focused tier (3 credits = 200 TRY)
- Badge changed from "Popüler" → "Tek Fiyat"
- Title: "Kredi Satın Al" (not "Kredi Paketleri")
- Subtitle emphasizes single-package simplicity
- Modular architecture for easy future expansion
- Stripe integration placeholder ready

**RevenueCat Best Practices Applied:**

- Total: 60 questions across 3 exams

**All UI Text Updated:**
